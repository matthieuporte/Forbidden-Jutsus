### Sets

you can create a set in python with

```python
myset = set()
```

you can add an element with `.add()`

```python
myset.add(elemtn)
```

and you can see whether an element is in the set with :

```python
if e in myset:
```

for some reasons this is very optimized (I don't get why though)


### Dictionaries

create a dictionary with :

```python
myDict = {}
```

check if a key is in Dict : 

```python
if key in myDict:
```

change the value of a key
